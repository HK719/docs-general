= Build an API Tutorial: Validation, Error Handling, and Unit Tests for the API
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

So far, we've created an API interface and implementation and tested the HTTP request with a third-party client.
Now, we'll use Studio to add error handling and a unit test. In Studio, we'll use the scaffolding already created to:

* Validate input using the Validation module
* Handle one type of error.
* Create a unit test on the payload value. 

== Validation

Add the Validation module to the API and test for the presence of any query parameters.
Since none are supported, we want to let the user know that instead of silently accepting any query.

. 

Move to operate chapter?
* Validate enforcement of applied resource-based policies
