= Anypoint Platform Hosting Options

MuleSoft provides and supports different hosting options to accomadate different data security, data privacy, and legal requirements. These options enable you to control the physical location where your and your customer's data are hosted. This includes

* Your assets, including API specifications and Mule applications
* Metadata about your assets
* Data that passes through your APIs and Mule applications.

This data remains within the physical location required by your companies IT policies and requirements. For example, MuleSoft provides an EU Cloud which enables you to maintain all of your data on your own data centers or within the European Union.

== Hosting Options for Mule Runtime Server

MuleSoft supports different environments that give you control over the physical location where your APIs and Mule applications are hosted. This ensures that data associated with each API and Mule application remains within the location you choose. The following diagram shows the different hosting options for Mule runtime server.

In this scenario, MuleSoft hosts Anypoint Platform, which includes Exchange, Design Center, and Management Center (API Manager and Runtime Manager). The diagram also lists the different hosting options for Mule runtime server, which include:

* CloudHub
+
CloudHub is MuleSoft's cloud-based environment that enables you deploy an API or a Mule application to hosted Mule runtime server. MuleSoft provides and maintains high availablity and fail-over. MuleSoft also provides clustering and failover of your APIs and Mule applications and load balances traffic to them. See xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] for more information.
+
CloudHub is supported in different cloud environments to accomodate your data and regulator requirements. See xref:Cloud Hosting Option[Cloud Hosting Options]

* Hybrid
+
A hybrid environment is an environment where you host APIs and Mule applications to your data center, but MuleSoft hosts the Design Center and Management Center components in the cloud. This scenario enables you to host Mule Runtime server in an environment that you manage. All customer data that passes through your API or Mule application remains in this environment.
+
Within a hybrid environment, you are responsible for providing the infrastructure where the Mule Runtime Server is hosted. In a Hybrid environment, the Mule Runtime Server can run on a physical server, a virtual machine, or within a 3rd-party cloud installation like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.
+
In this environment, you are responsible for providing the framework for high-availability, failover, clustering and load balancing.
+
See xref:runtime-manager::deployment-strategies#hybrid-deployments.adoc[Hybrid Deployments] for more information.

* Runtime Fabric
+
Runtime Fabric enables your to host Mule Runtime server within a data center that you control and manage. Similar to a hybrid installation, Runtime Fabric supports hosting Mule Runtime Servers in a physical server, a virtual machine or within Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Unlike a Hybrid environment, Runtime Fabric is a network appliance that uses Kubernetes to manage high-availability, failover, clustering, and load balancing.
