= Build an API Tutorial: Design an API
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

To design an API, assess the purpose and requirements:

* Identify the type of API. Is it a simple API, part of an integration, or part of a back-end system?
* Understand the data flows: one-way, two-way, or more.
* Explore the security requirements.

Once the scope and flow of your integration project is understood,
take the first step and define an API specification in RAML (or import to RAML from OAS).
Then, develop the apps that access the API resources.  

== API Specifications and APIs
An API is a published interface to a resource that anyone with the correct permissions
and properly structured request can access. 

An API specification details the functional and expected behavior of an API, 
as well as the fundamental design philosophy and supported data types.
It contains both documentation and API definitions 
to create a contract that humans and software can read. 

MuleSoft provides tools that make it easy to create an API specification that you can then share with your team or publicly.
The API specification increases adoption and speeds up project completion. 

== Step 1: Explore Existing API Specifications
If you look at existing API specifications before writing your own, you can learn how other people have approached similar problems. You can also check whether an asset with the same objectives is not already in development, and reuse it if appropriate.

Looking for an API specification that already does what you need is easy:

* Look at the public Exchange]. You’ll see some of the most popular API specifications, connectors, and other assets displayed.

 +
Click Training: American Flights API or any other API specification and inspect it. You can see the data types and the HTTP requests defined for the API. 
+
* To look at just the items in your organization (account) Exchange, 
log in to your Anypoint Platform account (your account).

== Step 2: Create Your API Specification
In link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/["Anypoint Platform^", role="button-primary"]:

. Click the blue button under Design Center to open the API Designer.
. Click *Create* to open the API Designer editor.
. Click *Create API specification*.
. Enter Hello-World for *Name* and leave the other default values.
. Click *Create Specification*.
. The API Designer editor displays starter text. Replace it with RAML that specifies the API:

[source,raml]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: Hello, World
version: v1
description: A greeting for the world

securitySchemes:
 basic:
   description: |
     This API supports Basic Authentication.
   type: Basic Authentication
 
securedBy: [basic]

types:
 greeting: # <2>
   properties:
     todays-greeting: string

/greeting:
 /{todays-greeting}:
     uriParameters:
       todays-greeting: string
     get: # <1>
       responses: # <3>
         200:
           body:
             application/json:
               type: greeting
         404: # <4>
           body:
             application/json:
               properties:
                 message: string
               example: |
                 {
                   "message" : "Greeting not found"
                 }
----
<1> A single HTTP request, GET
<2> A single dataType, greeting, with a single property, today’s message. 
<3> HTTP response
<4> Error message and error handling

== Step 3: Test Your API Specification
Now that you’ve created a Hello World specification, test it by sending a request.
The mocking service handles the creation of a functioning endpoint from your API specification
and provides a simple UI for managing authentication, request headers, and response headers.

To test your Hello World specification:

. link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/#/projects["Open the Hello World API specification that you created in Step 2.^" role="button-primary"]
. Click the X next to *Mocking service* to enable the mocking service. If you see a checkmark instead of an X, the mocking service is already enabled.
. Inspect the *API endpoints* that you defined. HTTP requests appear in green boxes.
. Click *GET* to display the GET endpoint. 
. Review the *Code examples* for each protocol.
. Review the *Security* method (basic authentication in this case).
. Review the *URI parameters*. 
. Click *Try it*.
. Enter the username and password needed to access this endpoint. In this example, you can enter any string.
. Click *Parameters* and enter `Hello World` for *todays-greeting*.
. Click *Send* to send your request to the temporary request URL that the mocking service creates from your specification. If the request is successful, you’ll see `*HTTP message 200 OK*`. 
. Examine the response headers and request headers in the mocking service to help diagnose issues or understand the behavior of your API specification.
. When you have finished testing, click the mocking service checkmark to exit.

== Step 4. Publish Your API Specification
After you have tested your API, publish it to your private Exchange so others in your organization can reuse your work.

. link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/#/projects["Open the Hello World API specification.^" role="button-primary"]
. Click Publish.
. Click Publish to Exchange. 

Now anyone in your organization can see the Hello-World API specification and reuse it.

== What’s Next
Now that you have designed an API and specified it so that anyone can use it, create a Mule app that contains the implementation and interface for the API, using Anypoint Studio.

== Developer Deep Dives

If you're curious about the details, dive right in.

=== Deep Dive: Exchange

You can publish assets to the public Exchange, your internal exchange or your public developer portal.

* In addition to the public Exchange, you can review your own organization’s internal offerings.
+

+
* If you've created a public developer portal, you can look there as well; click *Public portal*.

=== Deep Dive: Creating an API Specification

In a typical API project, you’d likely want to do a few more things:

* Add annotations.
