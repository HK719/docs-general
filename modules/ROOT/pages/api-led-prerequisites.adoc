Before you begin your API-led journey, verify that you have the basic tools and access needed.

* Username and password for your Anypoint Platform organization. If you don't have Anypoint Platform yet, create a Trial organization on Anypoint Platform.

* To test REST requests, obtain a client such as Advanced REST Client or Postman if you don't already have one. This tutorial uses Advanced REST Client.

Depending on your platform, you may need to install a different client, or https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/arc-electron/releases/tag/v15.0.0[install Advanced REST Client from GitHub].

== Helpful Hints

* Use two browser windows: one to read instructions and one to perform the tasks.
* Set Advanced REST Client to have a long timeout. When you step through the processes during debugging, you don't want the REST request to time out.
